## Commands

### Insert Big Image

Opens a dialog through which one or more images on disk can be selected. Intelligently splits up and inserts each selected image as a set of smaller images. (This is to workaround a limitation in Figma where images with a dimension larger than 4096 pixels are scaled down.)
